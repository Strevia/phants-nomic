Rule 8 Example: Player 1 has 12 blocks in her tower and successfully passes a change to rules.md, they would gain 1 * floor(log[base2]\(12)+1 points or 4 total points.

Rule 9 Example: Bartholomew has 12 blocks in her tower and would like to add another one. They would need to spend 12 points to do so.

Example of Tower Feature:

Name: Laser Cannon

Cost: 10 points

Effect: Single-use, lets you destroy one block from another player's tower

If you have a tower that is 12 blocks tall and 3 features you would have space for 9 more features. 

Apartment Cost Example: Player 2 has 4 apartments in their tower and wants to build a new one. It costs 2*(4+1)=10 blocks to do so.

Mk 2 Example: Player B has built 10 apartments. These combine into a single "Apartment Mk 2". If they wish to build another one, it costs 20x what it would normally cost, so 20*(2 * ([# of apartment Mk 2] + 1)) or 80 points, 10 height, and gives 10 population
