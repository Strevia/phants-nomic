## Rules

1. All players must agree to any changes to these rules, including all files in the folder containing these rules.

2. Any player may choose to go inactive at anytime. Inactive players do not vote on new rules. Inactive players may choose to become active again at any time. 

3. All rules should have a number, which counts sequentially up with each new rule.

4. Anytime a player proposes a change to rules.md and it passes, they get 1 point. All players start with 0 points after this rule is passed.

5. Points are used to build Kilocubit-sized blocks. 1 point can build 1 kilocubit-sized block.

6. Rules should be positive and affirmative of actions players can take, avoid negative language in rules. IF you must disallow something with a rule keep the ratio of positive to negative rules to under 3:1. 

7. Whoever builds a tower that reaches the Moon first wins. It takes 84,000,000 cubit-sized blocks to reach the Moon.

8. Players gain a multiplier to their points based on the floored log base 2 number of blocks in their tower. The full formula can be found in appendix_F.md. 

9. Once a block has been built, a player may add it to their tower at a point cost equal to the current height of the player's tower in number of blocks.

10. Players may create additional features which they can add to their towers. When creating a feature, a player needs to specify: a name, a cost in blocks and/or points, and a unique effect. These features will be stored in appendix_T.md.

11. The maximum number of features a tower can support is equal to its height.

12. Each new day starts at 00:00 UTC. Anything which references a number of days passing is referring to this.

13. For every tenth rule that is passed, every player (active or inactive) gains 3 points. These points are not effected by rule 8. This rule applies retroactively for any new players that join the game.

14. When a tower contains 10 of the same basic tower features, these features are combined into a single "Mk 2" version. If a player wishes to continue building this feature, they must use Mk 2 versions. Mk 2 versions of tower features cost 20x as much as their basic counterparts, require 10 height instead of 1, and provide 10x the effect of the basic tower feature.
